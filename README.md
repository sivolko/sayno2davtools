This repo is all about securing basic static sites from dev tools and basic inspect options but these are not full proof but could easily be bypass using keyboards shortcuts

*warnings* 
This is not 100% full proof solution. Anyhow js also works as client side so if you have to hide all APIs or scerets then use DB or render them as server side . 

This code is just for beginner or somehow avoid inspects method for static webApps . 

**Use**

Include  this code snippet to last body tag.

```js
<script src="https://sivolko.github.io/sayno2devtools/disable-devtool.min.js" defer></script>
